## Summary
With 20 years of experience in enterprise SaaS and PaaS, I deliver high-quality work quickly while leading design across multiple projects.

As AI has come to the forefront, my fascination has led me to explore its potential, integrate it into my workflows, explore capabilities through personal projects, and share that knowledge with others. I believe software as we know it will change dramatically, and I’m here for it. I’m eager to help bring the vast and emerging capabilities of AI to software and provide greater agency to people around the world.

I have an innate curiosity about technology and enjoy taking on increasingly complex challenges that blend people and technology—and now AI agents. I studied Computer Science and Psychology at Rensselaer and earned an M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction. Other highlights include completing MIT’s Entrepreneurship Development Program, presenting at the O’Reilly Strata Data Conference, and earning three patents: one for event tracking via CSS and two related to AI.
